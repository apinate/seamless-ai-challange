# Seamless.AI Challange

A web application allowing its users to search up to 25 company domains by entering the company names /separated by commas/.

## **Local Development Setup**

### **Workspace**
* ### Prerequisites
    * **Node.js** - see *.nvmrc* for the Node.js version, preferably use [*nvm*](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) ([installation guide](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation), [nvm use](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#nvmrc)).

### **Web Application**
* ### Prerequisites 
    * [**yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - [Install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-tab) `yarn` (preferably without `node` if you want to take advantage of `nvm`).

### **Running Locally**
1. Run `npm run setup` to setup all projects dependencies.
2. Start the sever by `npm run server:run`.
3. Run the web application by `npm run app:run`.

#### **Running Tests**
You can run both the server's and app's tests by `npm run test`.
